## Design

Welcome to CarCar - an application that allows a client to manage their car inventory, sales, and services.

CarCar is built using React for the frontend and utilizes microservices for architecture. Each functional area, such as inventory, sales, and service, is handled by a separate microservice - allowing for efficient development and scalability.

The inventory microservice allows for the management of cars in the inventory. Features that include adding, deleting, or updating car information. Through the polling mechanism, the application provides fast communication between the microservices - delivering the client information when neccessary.

The sales microservice tracks and manages car sales, including adding sales, viewing sales records, and management of sales personnel and potential customers.

The service microservice manages the technicians, scheduling of appointments, viewing appointment lists, and displaying the service history.

## Navigating the Server

To navigate the server, type ```http://localhost:3000``` , this will take you to our Home Page. Within the Home Page is a navigation bar for easy access to each feature that we created. Below is a complete breakdown of the urls for each feature of the application.

## API Outline

### Inventory API

The Inventory API utilizes RESTful methods that allows users to view a list of all manufacturers, create a new manufacturer, view all of the vehicle models, create a new vehicle model, list all of the automobiles, and create new automobiles.

- **List manufacturers** http://localhost:3000/manufacturers/list/
    -  List view of all the manufacturers inside the database
- **Create manufacturer** http://localhost:3000/manufacturers/new/
    - Allows the user to create a new instance of a manufacturer
    - The user inputs a manufacturer name that does not yet exist inside of the database
- **List vehicle models** http://localhost:3000/models/list/
    - List view of all vehicle models in the database
    - Delete a vehicle model instance from the database
- **Create vehicle models** http://localhost:3000/models/new/
    - Allows the user to create a new instance of a vehicle model
    - The user inputs a model name, a picture url of the vehicle, and selects a manufacturer from a dropdown
- **List of automobiles** http://localhost:3000/automobile/list/
    - List view of all automobiles inside of the database
    - Displayed on this list is the VIN, color, year, model, and manufacturer of the vehicle
- **Create an automobile** http://localhost:3000/automobile/new/
    - Allows the user to create a new instance of an automobile
    - The user inputs a color, year, VIN, and selects a model from a dropdown

### Service API

The Service API utilizes RESTful methods that allows users to view a list of appointments that are incomplete (in-progress), create an appointment, a view of all technicians, creating an instance of a technician, and a service history that details all appointment (in-progress and completed)

- **List of appointments** http://localhost:3000/appointments/list/
    -  List view of all appointments that have not yet been completed inside the database
    -  List view of in-progress appointments display the VIN, customer name, date, time, technician, and reason for appointment.
    -  The user also has the ability to cancel or complete an appointment
- **Create an appointment** http://localhost:3000/appointments/new/

## Service microservice

The Service microservice has three models: AutomobileVO, Technician, and Appointment. The AutomobileVO model is a value object which is a representation of the Automobile model in the ***Inventory microservice***. Through the use of a polling mechanism, we are able to poll data from the Automobile model in the Inventory microservice into the AutomobileVO in the Service microservice.

The ```AutomobileVO``` model contains the ```vin``` and ```import_href``` fields. This model is a value object that consistently polls for data from the Automobile model in the Inventory microservice.

The ```Technician``` model contains the ```technician_name``` and ```employee_number``` fields. This model is a source of information that stores data about technicians.

The ```Appointment``` model contains the ```vin```, ```customer_name```, ```date_time```, ```reason```, ```vip```, ```finished```, and ```technician_name``` fields. This model is a source of information that stores data about appointments. The ```vin``` field stores the VIN number of the associated vehicle. The ```vin``` field is not set as a foreign key because clients who do not own a vehicle from the inventory should also be able to make an appointment for services. The ```technician_name``` field is a foreign key to the ```Technician``` model - many appointments can have a single technician. The ```vip``` and ```finished``` fields are used to check for their status.

## Sales microservice

The Sales Microservice has four models: AutoVO, SalesPerson, Customer and SalesRecord. The AutoVO model is a value object which is a representation of the Automobile Model in the ***Inventory Microservice***.

The ```AutoVO``` model contains the ```color```, ```year```, ```vin```, ```available```, ```import_href``` fields.

The ```SalesPerson``` model contains the ```name``` and ```employee_number``` fields to store a sales employee information in the database.

The ```Customer``` model contains the ```name```, ```address```,  and ```phone_number``` field to store customer information in the database.

The ```SalesRecord``` model contains a  ```automobile``` field which is a foreign key to the ```AutoVO``` model as there can be many automobiles to record a sale for. It contains a ```salesperson``` field  which is a foreign key to the ```SalesPerson``` model as we need to have an existing SalesPerson to be able to record a sales record. It also contains a ```customer``` field which is a foreign key to the ```Customer``` model as we need to have an existing customer to be able to record a sales record. Lastly, it has a ```sales_price``` field to record the price the automobile was sold for.

An extra note: the AutoVO model has an additional property that the Automobile Model does not, which is the ***Available*** property. This will allow us to filter only vehicles that are available, meaning those that have not been sold, in order to create a Sales Record and avoid any confusion while selling a car. A vehicle created in the AutoVO model has a default available status set to **"True"** until a Sales Record is created with that vehicle vin.


There is a ***poll*** function that allows the Sales microservice to poll the Inventory every 60 seconds to make sure the Sales Microservice data is up to date. Every time the Sales Microservice polls the Inventory API, it either updates or creates an AutoVO instance.


In order to create a Sales Record, an automobile, customer and salesperson will have to be created. The Sales Record uses the ```href``` variable of the Automobile model as the value. Please refer to the example below.

The back-end of the Sales Microservices can be found following this path ***sales/api/sales_rest/views.py***. There is a view function for each model to properly ensure the back-end data is being created and stored properly. There is also an encoder for each view function to be able to parse through the data. For your convenience, we’ve added the required JSON Body beneath the RESTFul API table to be able to test these API calls through the Insomnia APP.
