## Design

Welcome to CarCar - an application that allows a client to manage their car inventory, sales, and services.

CarCar is built using React for the frontend and utilizes microservices for architecture. Each functional area, such as inventory, sales, and service, is handled by a separate microservice - allowing for efficient development and scalability.

The inventory microservice allows for the management of cars in the inventory. Features that include adding, deleting, or updating car information. Through the polling mechanism, the application provides fast communication between the microservices - delivering the client information when neccessary.

The sales microservice tracks and manages car sales, including adding sales, viewing sales records, and management of sales personnel and potential customers.

The service microservice manages the technicians, scheduling of appointments, viewing appointment lists, and displaying the service history.

## Navigating the Server

To navigate the server, type ```http://localhost:3000``` , this will take you to our Home Page. Within the Home Page is a navigation bar for easy access to each feature that we created. Below is a complete breakdown of the urls for each feature of the application.

## API Outline
